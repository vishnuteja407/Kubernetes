Metrics Server can be installed in high availability mode directly from a YAML manifest or via the official Helm chart by setting the replicas value greater than 1. To install the latest Metrics Server release in high availability mode from the high-availability.yaml manifest, run the following command.

On Kubernetes v1.21+:

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/high-availability-1.21+.yaml

On Kubernetes v1.19-1.21:

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/high-availability.yaml

Note

This configuration requires having a cluster with at least 2 nodes on which Metrics Server can be scheduled.
Also, to maximize the efficiency of this highly available configuration, it is recommended to add the --enable-aggregator-routing=true CLI flag to the kube-apiserver so that requests sent to Metrics Server are load balanced between the 2 instances.
